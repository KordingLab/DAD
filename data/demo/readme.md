Yte = training neural data

Ytr = test neural data

Tte = training target locations (0-7)

Ttr = test target locations (0-7)

Xte = training velocity data

Xtr = test velocity data

## instructions for dimensionality reduction

Yte = 803 x 187 matrix of firing rates (803 time points, 187 neurons)

1. run dimensionality reduction on the rows of Yte to obtain the top 2-3 factors for each of the 803 data points
2. Plot the 2 x 803 matrix of coefficients
