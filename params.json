To train a decoder,\r\nwe generally need infer the variables of interest (covariates) using simultaneously measured\r\nneural activity. However, there are many cases where this approach is not possible. Here we\r\novercome this problem by introducing a fundamentally new approach for decoding called\r\ndistribution alignment decoding (DAD). We use the statistics of movement, much like cryptographers\r\nuse the statistics of language, to find a mapping between neural activity and motor\r\nvariables. DAD learns a linear decoder which aligns the distribution of its output with the\r\ntypical distribution of motor outputs by minimizing their KL-divergence. We apply our approach\r\nto a two datasets collected from the motor cortex of non-human primates (NHPs): a\r\nreaching task and an isometric force production task. We study the performance of DAD and\r\nfind regimes where DAD provides comparable and in some cases, better performance than\r\na typical supervised decoder. As DAD does not rely on the ability to record motor-related\r\noutputs, it promises to broaden the set of potential applications of brain decoding.\r\n\r\n### Code and Data ###\r\nCode and data to generate figures in the paper are in the GitHub repo associated with this page.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have questions, please contact Eva\\{dot\\}L\\{dot\\}Dyer\\{at\\}Gmail\\{dot\\}com.\r\n\r\n![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KordingLab/DAD/master/images/MainFig_GitHubSite.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
