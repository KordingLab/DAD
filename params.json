The details of DAD are contained in this paper.\r\n\r\nEL Dyer, M Gheshlaghi Azar, HL Fernandes, M Perich, L Miller, KP K\\\"ording: __Cracking the neural code: A cryptography-inspired approach for brain decoding__, [preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqdabo7drryq42m/Dyer_DAD2016.pdf?dl=0), May 2016. \r\n\r\n__Abstract:__ Brain decoders use neural recordings to infer a user’s mental state,  i.e.,  what someone is thinking, viewing, or their intended movement. Approaches for brain decoding typically rely on simultaneous measurements of the user’s mental state and their neural activity in order to train a decoder. However, there are many cases where measuring the brain state of interest along with neural activity is difficult.Here we introduce a new approach for decoding called distribution alignment decoding (DAD), that does not require direct measurement of the user’s mental state and their neural activity to find a mapping between the two.  We use thestatistics of movement, in the same way as cryptographers use the statistics of language, to find a mapping between neural activity and movement.  To do this,we find a linear decoder that aligns the distribution of its output with the typical distribution of the user’s intended movement by minimizing their KL-divergence.We apply our approach to a dataset collected from the motor cortex of non-human primates (NHPs) during a reaching task, and demonstrate regimes where DAD provides comparable and in some cases, better performance than a supervised decoder.  As DAD does not rely on training data with known correspondence between inputs (neural activity) and outputs (motor task), it promises to broaden the set of potential applications of brain decoding.\r\n\r\n### Code and Data ###\r\nCode and data to generate figures in the paper are in the GitHub repo associated with this page.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have questions, please contact edyer\\{at\\}northwestern\\{dot\\}edu.\r\n",
